/**
 * Cron jobs for async webhook processing.
 *
 * Two workers run on a regular cadence:
 *
 * 1. **Process pending** (every 10 seconds)
 *    Picks up events with processState="pending" and dispatches them
 *    through the handler pipeline. Successful events are marked "processed";
 *    failures get exponential backoff retries.
 *
 * 2. **Promote retries** (every 30 seconds)
 *    Finds events in "retry" state whose backoff window has elapsed
 *    and resets them to "pending" so the next processing pass picks them up.
 *
 * Together these form the async processing loop described in Slice 9:
 *
 *   HTTP webhook  ──▶  persist (pending)  ──▶  cron processes  ──▶  processed
 *                                                  │ failure
 *                                                  ▼
 *                                            retry (backoff)
 *                                                  │ promoted
 *                                                  ▼
 *                                              pending (again)
 *                                                  │ MAX_ATTEMPTS exhausted
 *                                                  ▼
 *                                            dead letters
